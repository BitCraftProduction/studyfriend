The **Intel 8085 microprocessor**, introduced in the mid-1970s, played a pivotal role in the evolution of microprocessor technology. Known for its simplicity and educational significance, the 8085 is an 8-bit microprocessor used in embedded systems, microcontroller applications, and as a training tool in academic institutions. This article delves deep into the architecture, instruction set, and real-world applications of the 8085 microprocessor.


## 1. Introduction to 8085 Microprocessor

The **8085 microprocessor** is a general-purpose 8-bit microprocessor developed by Intel in 1976. It is fabricated using NMOS technology and operates on a single +5V power supply. The '5' in 8085 denotes its requirement for a 5V power supply, distinguishing it from its predecessor, the 8080.

Key specifications:

* **Data Bus Width**: 8-bit
* **Address Bus Width**: 16-bit
* **Clock Speed**: 3 MHz (typically)
* **Instruction Set**: 74 basic instructions
* **Pins**: 40-pin Dual Inline Package (DIP)
* **Memory Addressing Capacity**: 64KB (2^16)

 

## 2. Architecture of 8085 Microprocessor

The architecture of the 8085 microprocessor is organized around a set of functional blocks that allow efficient data manipulation and instruction execution.

### 2.1 Block Diagram Overview

The major functional components of the 8085 include:

* **Accumulator (A)**: An 8-bit register used for arithmetic, logic, and data transfer operations.
* **Arithmetic & Logic Unit (ALU)**: Performs arithmetic and logical operations.
* **General Purpose Registers**: B, C, D, E, H, and L – six 8-bit registers that can be paired as BC, DE, and HL.
* **Program Counter (PC)**: 16-bit register that holds the address of the next instruction to be executed.
* **Stack Pointer (SP)**: 16-bit register that points to the top of the stack.
* **Instruction Register and Decoder**: Temporarily holds the current instruction and decodes it.
* **Control Unit**: Generates control signals required for instruction execution.
* **Flag Register**: Contains five flip-flops to indicate the status of the ALU: Sign, Zero, Auxiliary Carry, Parity, and Carry.

### 2.2 Control & Status Signals

* **ALE (Address Latch Enable)**: Used to demultiplex the address and data bus.
* **RD and WR**: Indicate read and write operations.
* **IO/M**: Distinguishes memory and I/O operations.

### 2.3 Interrupt System

The 8085 supports five hardware interrupts:

* TRAP (Non-maskable, highest priority)
* RST7.5
* RST6.5
* RST5.5
* INTR (General purpose)

These facilitate external devices to interrupt normal program flow, enabling responsive embedded applications.
