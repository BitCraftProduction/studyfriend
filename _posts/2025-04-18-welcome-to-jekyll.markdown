You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```
This is code. I hope you got it.

/* Style for preformatted code blocks */
pre code {
  display: block;
  background: #0f111a; /* Dark background */
  color: #f8f8f2; /* Light text */
  padding: 1em;
  margin: 1.5em 0;
  border-radius: 10px;
  font-size: 15px;
  font-family: 'Fira Code', 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;
  overflow-x: auto;
  line-height: 1.6;
  box-shadow: 0 6px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25);
}

/* Optional: Customize scrollbar for code blocks */
pre code::-webkit-scrollbar {
  height: 10px;
}
pre code::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb {
  background-color: #444;
  border-radius: 10px;
}
pre code::-webkit-scrollbar-track {
  background: #1e1e1e;
}

/* Inline code (optional) */
code {
  background-color: #f1f1f1;
  color: #d6336c;
  padding: 2px 6px;
  border-radius: 4px;
  font-family: 'Fira Code', monospace;
  font-size: 0.95em;
}


```
